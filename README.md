# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Projects – Ad Hoc Business & Domain-Specific Insights

Welcome to my **Ad Hoc Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** repository, where I've conducted a series of self-initiated, domain-specific data investigations across various industries such as **retail, healthcare, finance, entertainment, public infrastructure**, and **sports analytics**. These projects are built with a real-world problem-solving mindset and showcase my ability to **extract actionable insights from raw data**, **communicate findings effectively**, and **make data-driven decisions**.

## 📌 Project Descriptions

### 🏙️ 1. Delhi Metro Network Analysis
- Visualized the metro line connectivity using graphs.
- Identified interchange stations and critical routes using **network theory**.
- Tools: NetworkX, Pandas, Matplotlib.

### 🛍️ 2. Diwali Sales Analysis
- Analyzed festival season sales data to uncover revenue trends, high-performing product categories, and demographics.
- Created **segmentation reports** and **pivot tables** for business strategies.
- Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Excel.

### 📱 3. Google Play Store EDA
- Explored metadata of apps: category, rating, price, installs.
- Assessed what influences **app ratings and popularity**.
- Visualized trends in free vs. paid apps, user engagement, and categories.

### 🩺 4. Health Monitoring and Clinical Records
- **Heart Failure Dataset**: Studied key clinical features (e.g., age, EF, serum creatinine) affecting mortality.
- **Kidney Disease Dataset**: Correlated health indicators with disease presence using heatmaps and distributions.
- Supported **healthcare diagnostic hypotheses**.

### 🏨 5. Hotel Booking Analysis
- Investigated customer behaviors: cancellations, booking channels, lead time.
- Identified **peak months**, **repeat guests**, and patterns that affect revenue.
- Helped simulate a hotel revenue management strategy.

### 🏠 6. Housing Price Analysis
- Evaluated impact of features (location, square footage, number of bedrooms) on house price.
- Built correlation heatmaps and distribution plots for **feature selection**.
- Inferred ideal investment criteria.

### 📈 7. Stock Market Portfolio Optimization
- Analyzed historical stock prices and returns.
- Created correlation matrices and **Sharpe ratio simulations** for optimized portfolios.
- Tools: `yfinance`, NumPy, Matplotlib.

### 🏏 8. T20 World Cup 2024 Match Analysis
- Performed player and team-level analysis on match datasets.
- Derived metrics like **strike rate**, **economy rate**, and **win probabilities**.
- Useful for fantasy leagues and sports commentary insights.

### 🎬 9. TMDB Movie Data Analysis
- Scraped and analyzed movie metadata like runtime, revenue, genre.
- Discovered patterns in **successful movies** by budget, cast, and release timing.
- Tools: Pandas, Plotly, WordCloud.
